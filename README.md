## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 📌 **Option 1: Contributing to the Project (Fork & Clone)**

If you want to contribute to the codebase, follow these steps:

#### **Step 1: Fork the Repository**
1. Go to the [OpenCodeHub repository](https://github.com/yourusername/opencodehub)
2. Click the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner
3. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account

#### **Step 2: Clone Your Forked Repository**
```bash
# Clone your fork (replace 'yourusername' with your GitHub username)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/opencodehub.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd opencodehub
```

---

### 📌 **Option 2: Just Using the Project (Direct Clone)**

If you just want to use the application without contributing:

```bash
# Clone the repository directly
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/opencodehub.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd opencodehub
```

---

### 🔧 **Common Setup Steps (After Cloning)**

#### **Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment**

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate

# You should see (venv) in your terminal prompt
```

**Verify Activation:**
```bash
# Check if virtual environment is active
where python

# Should point to the venv directory
```

---

#### **Step 2: Create Environment Variables File**

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory (same level as `manage.py`):

Add the following configuration to `.env`:

```env
# Supabase Database URL (PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.xxxxx:your-password@aws-x-xx-xxxxx-x.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
```

**⚠️ Important Security Notes:**
- Never commit `.env` to version control
- Keep your database password confidential
- Each team member should have their own .env file with their own credentials
  
---

#### **Step 3: Install Project Dependencies**

```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is activated (you should see (venv) in the prompt)

# Install all required packages from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Wait for all packages to install (this may take a few minutes)
```

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
# Check installed packages
pip list

# You should see Django, and other dependencies
```
---

#### **Step 4: Run the Development Server**

```bash
# Start the Django development server
python manage.py runserver

# Server will start on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```
---

#### **Step 8: Access the Application**

Open your web browser and navigate to:

**Main Application:**
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

**Admin Panel:**
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
